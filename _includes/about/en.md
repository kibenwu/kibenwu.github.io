**Hey, I’m Kiven Wu**, an emotional clown immersed in logical chains. I love coding, reading philosophy, and dreaming about poetry and distant places.

I’ve been in the game industry for over 15 years, having worked on various projects big and small. Yet, I still hold onto my passion for making games. That’s why I spend my spare time working on indie projects—one of which is now available on **Steam**! Feel free to **add it to your wishlist or purchase it**. I’d really appreciate the support!

This space is where I store my notes, insights, and summaries. The idea came to me after a job transition when I realized that a lot of my knowledge and project files had either been lost or were no longer accessible. I often remember working on something, only to find that I can’t retrieve it anymore. So, I decided to document things here—not just for convenience but also for that little **“Wow, I used to work so hard!”** moment of self-satisfaction.

This space will mainly be divided into **two categories**:

1. **Technical Art (TA) resources and summaries**—Whether from past experiences or future explorations, I’ll be organizing relevant knowledge here. Even if I haven’t created a project myself, I’ll document my research and findings for others to reference.
2. **Indie game design thoughts & book notes**—I have a habit of **typing out key takeaways from books I’ve read**, making it easier to reference them later. These will be tagged accordingly, though I won’t be too meticulous about organizing every detail (yes, I can be a bit lazy).

### **Here’s the Steam link to my indie game!**

If you’re interested, please consider adding it to your wishlist or purchasing it. **Much appreciated!** 🚀
